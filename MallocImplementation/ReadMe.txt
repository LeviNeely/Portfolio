Hello! And welcome to my version of malloc() and free().
In order to utilize my version, all you need to do is simply open the
directory and use the command "make" to make the executable.
If you instead use the commmand "make test" it will run the tests
looking for memory leaks. If you run the command "make benchmark" the
program will run a series of benchmark tests comparing the in system
malloc() with MSDMalloc(). All .cpp and .h files have been included.
