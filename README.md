# Portfolio
This portfolio contains all my coding projects to date!

Below, I have listed all of the directories found inside my portfolio and a short description of what can be found within. Please contact me with any inquiries at levijneely@gmail.com.

Asteroids: A video game developed using SFML in C++. Utilizes collision detection, randomized enemies, health tracking, and increasing difficulty levels.

BeeWebGame: A simple JavaScript web game where randomly-generated bees follow the mouse cursor and the user avoids collision.

BinarySearchTree: A Java implementation of a binary search tree with helper functions.

BlockCipher: A short C++ program that takes in a message from the user, encrypts it using a BlockCipher with shuffle tables, and decrypts it again for proof of concept.

DNSResolver: A simplified Java implementation of the DNS protocol that parses requests received from the dig command line tool, checkes an implemented local cache for unexpired responses, forwards 
the request if not present in the cache, then provides a response to the request.

DiabetesCalculator: A simple calculator coded in Java that takes in information about the user, information about the meal being consumed, then calculates the appropriate dose of insulin along with 
the best dosing strategy using the Warsaw method.

DiyVector: A basic C++ implementation of a templatized vector with methods similar to the builtin vector.

Fractions: Basic Java implementation of fractions to add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc. fractions input by the user.

InteractiveTimesTable: A JavaScript web-based interactive times table, showing what the product of two numbers are using color-changing and cursor-oriented user interaction.

MallocImplementation: A self-implemented malloc() and free() replacement coded in C++. Tested and shown to be only ~30x slower than the builtin malloc() and free().

MathematicalScriptingApp: This is an app developed with Qt and written in C++. It has the possibility to parse input text, interpret that text, or print it in a more visually pleasing way.

PacManPathFinder: A graph-based pathfinding Java program that takes in a maze and finds the shortest path to the destination.

QuickSortAndMergeSort: QuickSort and MergeSort implementation in Java that compares and contrasts the two implementations.

SimpleWebChat: A Java implementation of a web chat that allows for users to join a chat room, send and receive messages from others in the chat room, and leave the chat room.

Synthesizer: A Java-implemented synthesizer that allows the user to select frequencies and modify resulting tones produced by the synthesizer.

UnixShell: A Unix Shell crafted in C++ that contains the capability to run commands, utilize I/O redirection, and execute tab completion. Utilizes syscalls, pipes, and methodical error handling.
