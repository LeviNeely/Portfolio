Hello! 

Great job at finding the project that utilizes the SFML graphics library. This was a fun game to make!

When you are writing a review of one of these projects, **make sure to include some sort of critique that would make the project better**, something that you might do differently if you were the one creating this project.
Since the SFML graphics library is all about drawing shapes, please make sure to **use a shape in your reply to the main discussion**. Props if you can figure out a way to include a dodecahedron!
