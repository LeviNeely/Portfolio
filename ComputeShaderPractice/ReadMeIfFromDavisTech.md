Hello and welcome! 

Feel free to meander through my projects, but to find some instructions on what to post, look in the following areas:

1. For instructions regarding a reply to the main discussion, look in the project that uses the SFML library.
2. For instructions regarding a reply to a classmate's comment, look in the project that uses the command ```node ./main.js``` to run the project.
