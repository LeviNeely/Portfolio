Hello!

Great job finding the project that used Node.js! This was a fun little project to get familiar with something that was new to me.

It's important to stay up to date with the latest technologies as the languages, frameworks, and systems we use are constantly being improved and changed. When you are replying to a classmate, **connect your discussion to something that you recently learned**. Additionally, **find a way to reference the TV show or movie that you most recently viewed**.
